## Pricing:

The prices are fetched from an API. Check [dagligepriser](https://github.com/Herover/heissepreise) to see how data is fetched, and make backend later.

## Recipe:

Make recipes which show what the total cost is from the data.

## Tracking:

Track prices and maybe highlight cheapest recipe daily for users.
